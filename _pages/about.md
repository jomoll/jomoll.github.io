Currently I am a PhD candidate at the Technical University of Munich supervised by <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/rueckert-daniel">Daniel Rueckert</a> and advised by <a href="https://www.radiologie.mri.tum.de/en/team/keno_bressem">Keno Bressem</a>, <a href="https://www.ias.tum.de/ias/adams-lisa/">Lisa Adams</a>, and <a href="https://www.kiinformatik.mri.tum.de/de/team/jiazhen_pan"> Jiazhen Pan</a>.

My research includes two major threads:
1. developing visionâ€“language models to improve healthcare outcomes.
2. evaluating models for clinical applications, with an emphasis on assessing reasoning, faithfulness, and reliability of LLMs and VLMs in real medical use cases.
