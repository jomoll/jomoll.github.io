Currently I am a PhD candidate in Technical University of Munich advised by <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/rueckert-daniel">Daniel Rueckert</a>, <a href="https://www.radiologie.mri.tum.de/en/team/keno_bressem">Keno Bressem</a>, and <a href="https://www.ias.tum.de/ias/adams-lisa/">Lisa Adams.<br>

My research includes two major threads:
1. developing visionâ€“language models to improve healthcare outcomes.
2. evaluating models for clinical applications, with an emphasis on assessing reasoning, faithfulness, and reliability of LLMs and VLMs in real medical use cases.
