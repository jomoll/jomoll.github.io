I'm passionate about using data to solve important problems in areas such as healthcare, education, and socioeconomic disparity.
My ultimate goal is to steer emerging technology's societal impact in a positive direction.

Currently I am a final-year PhD candidate in Stanford's Electrical Engineering (EE) Dept advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/">John Pauly</a>, <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/akshay-chaudhari">Akshay Chaudhari</a>, and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/">Gordon Wetzstein</a>.
My research includes two major threads:
1. harnessing foundation models to improve healthcare workflows
2. developing machine learning (ML) algorithms for computational imaging, spanning computer vision and inverse problems
